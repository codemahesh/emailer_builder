# Google Sheets Integration — Status Tracker

Source: `issues.md` in this folder. Update this file as issues are picked up, completed, or blocked. Designed for a Ralph loop to read at the start of each iteration and pick the next unblocked `todo` issue.

**Progress:** 8 / 10 done (80%)

```
[████████████████░░░░] 80%
```

---

## Status legend

- `todo` — not started, not yet picked up
- `in_progress` — currently being worked on (one at a time per loop)
- `blocked` — waiting on another issue or external input
- `review` — implementation done, awaiting human review / merge
- `done` — merged and verified

Unblocked at start: **Issue 1**.
After Issue 1 done: **2, 4** become unblocked.
After Issue 4 done: **5, 7** unblock (and **6** when 2 also done).

## Ralph loop guidance

1. Open this file. Find the lowest-numbered issue whose status is `todo` AND whose `Blocked by` issues are all `done`.
2. Mark it `in_progress`, fill the `Started` cell with today's date (YYYY-MM-DD).
3. Read the matching issue body in `issues.md` and implement it end-to-end (schema → API → worker → UI → tests as applicable).
4. Verify all acceptance criteria pass locally.
5. Mark it `done`, fill `Completed`, update the progress counter at the top, and re-render the progress bar.
6. Commit the changes and the updated `STATUS.md` together.
7. Loop.

If an issue cannot proceed (external blocker, ambiguous spec), set status to `blocked` with a one-line reason in `Notes` and move to the next unblocked issue.

Append a one-line entry below each time an issue's status changes. Newest at the top.
